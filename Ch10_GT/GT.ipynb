    "- Kruskal’s algorithm is primarily used for finding a minimum spanning tree. The minimum spanning tree of a graph connects all its vertices together with no cycles and the minimum possible total edge weight.\n",
    "- One common implementation of Kruskal’s algorithm uses the “union-find” technique. Three functions are necessary : make_set, find and union. The three functions use a dictionary : “parent”, where keys are vertices and values are the corresponding vertex “root”. The “root” of a graph is the unique vertex that does not have a parent (see implementation details below).\n",
    "- Make_set : function that sets the value of a given vertex to “None” in the dictionary “parent” (it creates a singleton). In other terms, at the beginning of the algorithm, each vertex has no parent.\n",
    "- Find : function that recursively searches for the “root” of the graph (as defined above) of a given vertex. The “root” of the graph will be the last element flagged as “None” in the parent dictionary.We will see later that if we want clusters then it means that there are as many roots as clusters and it will be our condition for stopping early Kruskal’s algorithm. If we want the minimum spanning tree then we only want one root and consequently one cluster.\n",
    "- Union : function that groups two vertices by their roots. It starts by searching the roots of the two vertices with the “Find” function above and if the two roots are different then we change the root of the second vertex with the root of the first vertex.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Efficiently manage a collection of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets. Primarily used to determine whether two elements are in the same set and to merge two sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Find**: Determine which set a particular element belongs to. This is used to check if two elements are in the same set.\n",
    "- **Union**: Merge two sets into a single set. The smaller set (or the set with the higher rank if using rank optimization) is typically merged into the larger one to keep the tree flat.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Operations**:\n",
    "- **Initialization**: Each element forms its own set.\n",
    "- **Find Operation**: Follows the chain of parent pointers from the element up until it reaches a root element, which is the representative (or parent) of the set. Path compression can be applied to flatten the structure, making future searches faster.\n",
    "- **Union Operation**: Joins two sets together by linking the root of one set to the root of another. By using techniques like union by rank or size, the height of trees can be minimized to optimize the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications**: Network connectivity, Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm, finding cycles in a graph, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kruskal's Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph. An MST is a subset of the edges that connects all vertices together, without any cycles, and with the minimum possible total edge weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps**:\n",
    "1. **Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.**\n",
    "2. **Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the MST so far. If not, add it to the MST.**\n",
    "3. **Repeat step 2 until there are (V-1) edges in the MST, where V is the number of vertices.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts**:\n",
    "- **Greedy Algorithm**: Kruskal's algorithm is greedy because it picks the smallest weight edge that doesn't cause a cycle at each step.\n",
    "- **Cycle Detection**: Utilizes the Union-Find algorithm to detect cycles. Before adding an edge, it checks if the vertices of the edge are in the same set. If they are, adding the edge would create a cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications**: Design of networks (telecommunication, electrical, water supply), approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems, and other scenarios where a minimal spanning structure is needed.\n"
